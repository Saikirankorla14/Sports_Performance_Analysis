# Sports_Performance_Analysis

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sports player statistics (e.g., NBA, FIFA) to understand performance trends and predict future outcomes. Machine learning models and statistical tools are used to draw insights from the dataset and make performance predictions.
Dataset
The NBA Player Stats dataset includes various player performance metrics such as points per game, assists, rebounds, steals, and shooting percentages. This dataset serves as the foundation for predictive analysis.
Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and standardizing data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key statistics and trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Feature Selection: Selecting important features influencing player performance.
- Model Training: Using models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to predict performance scores.
- Model Evaluation: RÂ² Score, MAE, and RMSE used to evaluate prediction quality.
Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas and NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
Learning Outcomes
- Understand how to analyze player performance using statistics.
- Learn how to preprocess and visualize sports data.
- Build and evaluate regression models for predicting sports performance.
- Gain insights into how statistical metrics influence overall player value.
